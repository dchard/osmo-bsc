=== Message Limitation Details

[[RESET_FAILURE]]
==== RESET FAILURE

Encoding of this message is implemented, but there is currently no
condition in the OsmoBSC code that would make a RESET operation fail on
an existing cell, except if the CBC were to identify
a non-existent cell in its _Cell List IE_.

[[KEEP_ALIVE]]
==== KEEP-ALIVE

The message is received and generates a corresponding KEEP-ALIVE
COMPLETE answer.  However, the _Keep Alive Repetition Period IE_ is not
interpreted.

[[RESTART]]
==== RESTART

The RESTART message is sent only at the time of establishment of every
CBSP link.  It is not sent when subsequent cells become available during
runtime of the CBSP link.
