== Control interface

The actual protocol is described in <<common-control-if>>, the variables
common to all programs using it are described in <<ctrl_common_vars>>. Here we
describe variables specific to OsmoBSC. The commands starting with prefix
"bts.N." are specific to a certain BTS so N have to be replaced with BTS
number when issuing command e. g. "bts.1.channel-load". Similarly the
TRX-specific commands are additionally prefixed with TRX number e. g.
"bts.1.trx.2.arfcn".

[[notif]]
=== notification

Setting this variable initiate TRAP "notification" to all the clients connected
to control interface with the value supplied in SET operation. This is not
intended to be used outside of local systems.

[[infomsc]]
=== inform-msc-v1

Setting this variable initiate TRAP "inform-msc-v1" to all connected MSCs 
control interfaces with the value supplied in SET operation.

[[chanlo]]
=== channel-load

Obtain channel load for given BTS. Returns concatenated set of triplets
("<name>,<used>,<total>") for all channel types configured on the BTS. The
"<name>" is the channel type. The "<used>" is the number of channels of that
type currently in use. The "<total>" is the number of channels of that type
configured on the BTS.

[[gprsm]]
=== gprs-mode

Set/Get the GPRS mode of the BTS. One of the following is
accepted/returned: "none", "gprs", "egprs".

[[rfs]]
=== rf_state

Following triplet is returned: "<oper>,<admin>,<pol>". The "<oper>" might be
"operational" or "inoperational" representing different operational states. The
"<admin>" might be "locked" or "unlocked" representing administrative status.
The "<pol>" might be "off", "on", "grace" or "unknown" representing different
RF policies.

[[rfl]]
=== rf_locked

Set/Get RF locked status. The GET operation will return either "0" or "1"
depending on the RF lock status. The SET operation will set  RF lock status if
RF Ctrl is enabled in the BSC Configuration.

[[mpr]]
=== max-power-reduction

Set/Get the value of maximum power reduction. Even values between 0 and 22 are
accepted.

FIXME: add variables defined in src/ctrl/control_if.c?
