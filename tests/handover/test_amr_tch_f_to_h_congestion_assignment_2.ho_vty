# Congestion check: Upgrading worst candidate from TCH/H -> TCH/F
# There is only one BTS. The TCH/H slots are congested. Since
# assignment is performed to less-congested TCH/F, the candidate with
# the worst RX level is chosen. (So far like test 22.)
# After that, trigger more congestion checks to ensure stability.
