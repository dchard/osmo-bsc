# Handover due to maximum TA exceeded
# The MS in the current (best) cell has reached maximum allowed timing
# advance. No handover is performed until the timing advance exceeds
# it. The originating cell is still the best, but no handover is
# performed back to that cell, because the penalty timer (due to
# maximum allowed timing advance) is running.
