# No (or not enough) measurements for handover
# Do not solve congestion in cell, because there is no measurement.
# As soon as enough measurements available (1 in our case), perform
# handover. Afterwards the old cell becomes congested and the new
# cell is not. Do not perform handover until new measurements are
# received.
