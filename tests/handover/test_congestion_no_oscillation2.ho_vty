# Almost identical to test_amr_oscillation.ho_vty, this has just two more TCH/H slots in BTS 1, and does not trigger the
# oscillation bug. The number of free TCH/H in BTS 1 should be unrelated to the congestion status of BTS 0, which
# illustrates that the even distribution of congestion is fundamentally flawed.
# This test script shows the desired behavior, though by common sense there should be no reason why we see the bug in
# test_amr_oscillation.ho_vty and not here.
