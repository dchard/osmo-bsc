# No Hysteresis and minimum RX level
# If current cell's RX level is below mimium level, handover must be
# performed, no matter of the hysteresis. First do not perform
# handover to better neighbor cell, because the hysteresis is not
# met. Second do not perform handover because better neighbor cell is
# below minimum RX level. Third perform handover because current cell
# is below minimum RX level, even if the better neighbor cell (minimum
# RX level reached) does not meet the hysteresis.
